I hv personally observed there are very top quality programmers exist into every software house but how to handle with data like data normalization data analysis reporting such experts are not as such common. I personally feel the most important thing is data normalization and once you hv data obviously it would be into raw form but when you work onto it then do your max effort on data normalization and provide the data into most most beautiful form to your client. Nothing more hv to do for client. Draw different designs and shapes of data through reporting.
Mene BA ki hui hai MA kar raha hu kya data analyst course kar sakta hu job mil jaayegi?

Its Odin school scam chronology ko samjhiye ye scammer hai every person who comes here from any background is from odin school which is very costly I already unsubscribed him and dislike requesting everyone to watch his other videos you will get to know not genuine person on watching his first video with aman i was inspired but when watched other videos looked like Ek hi school hai duniya me Odin school .<br>promotion karna hai to paid promotion kar na discliamer dall ke why fooling your audince?
Sallary package kya mila hai?

Koi proper platform h ky ? Jh s Sikh sakhte hai
Konsa school? Odi school?
"Hello guys , I am a bSC biology student . From where should i learn data analystics ? like any institue ? or where ?"
Well organised scam of Odian school in every video 😂
Very good 👍
You are doing a great job through these for freshers to give background but with all due respect the packages you share is not gonna help the freshers as this will mislead them in their career. A pckage should be proportional to years of experience ofcrse there are exceptions to this but this is an average fact and assists job sustainity....freshers would get mislead into frequent changes. Would recommend to keep the videos to give exposure to various fields that would help the younger batches and ofcrse your views will still be same I am sure
❤️💯
Got motivated ❣️
I motivated so muchh from this video
Nidhi is so calm.

Bhut hi inspiring career hai aapka as a data analytics. Mai 29 year ka hu aur mai non-technical background se aata hu. Mujhe data analytics karna hai. To kya mai iss age par aakr kar sakta hu. Job milegi mujhe.?? Please help me.
"I have been a data analyst for 2 years now and have gotten offers from paytm, Snapdeal, etc. I will be completely honest here, in India as a data analyst u only need excel and SQL in 90% of Indian companies. They don’t really care about python. Barely sometimes, some minor work comes on python. Nobody even cares about R language lol. Stop lying and putting unnecessary pressure on people here, nobody asks AI questions because that’s what data scientists do. Hope this helps all the upcoming data analysts."
Inspiring Video for an aspiring Data Analyst .... Kudos 👏
"I was there a decade or so ago when Data Science+ AI/ML was picking up. In my universitiy we&#39;d have engineers from R language making presentations and it all sparked enthusiasm. Few of us who took it seriously back then are raking in millions now.<br>Cut to the present times, these buzzwords have been mainstreamed, and somewhat trivilized so much so that it is very difficult to spot a great Data scientist amongst a horde. <br>At present another subfield is gaining currency-- which will be used to solve problems of the future. The person who is going to master it today is going to be a gem in the future. I&#39;ll give a hint-- it requires a knowledge of biological systems; something, in which Nidhi is educated."

I&#39;m a aspiring data analyst I&#39;ve just completed my certification along with all the tools for programming and visualisation and applying for jobs actively. However I&#39;m not getting any response from the companies since I&#39;m from non-tech background and I&#39;ve work experience for 3 years in amazon customer service. I&#39;m just blank and loosing hope either I&#39;m going to be a data analyst or not

"Data analytics never demands computer science background neither CS student go for data analytics program they are happy with coding and developing...as word is enough analytics mean analysis data using tools that enough for understanding and master using this tool (SQL,python,powerbi)🔥 that&#39;s what make difference just tell what you are doing...you can switch any field one life do whatever coz you only live once choose what makes you happy.."
I am struggling to get back with data analytics after my career break ..since 6 months I have been trying .. no luck .. the one who is in break do not do the mistake of changing technology as they ask for experience
mujha tho abhi bhi nhi pata tha ki phyton koi snake ka name hai...............
"I studied without any courses and any help and I can tell you if I can do it then anyone can do it. There are plenty of free videos available in YouTube. The best way to learn is to learn by doing. The more projects you do the more you learn. You will learn concepts as you do the projects. And the most important thing is consistency. Make a plan, spend 1 hour in the morning and 1 in the evening. I used to study 4 hours everyday.<br><br>This is a brilliant podcast and thank you for doing this."
